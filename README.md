# BlitLife
### an implementation of the Life cellular automaton using the Amiga's hardware blitter

What we have here is an implementation of John Horton Conway's "Life" game,
the famous cellular automaton, in which the growth algorithm is implemented on an Amiga
using the "blitter", controlled by direct hardware pokes.

At bottom, the blitter does logical operations on large fields of bits, such as AND or XOR,
combining up to three inputs and barrel-shifting them as necessary to align with each other.
By decomposing the numeric operations of the life algorithm (such as counting neighbors)
into a basic logical form, the blitter can implement the Life growth algorithm as a series of steps,
each one acting on the entire map in a single asynchronous operation.
This is probably not perfectly optimized in terms of the sequence of steps necessary to
implement the life algorithm with blitter operations.
The approach is loosely based on an old version that uses the word-length logical operations available to a typical computer.

As a user-friendly tool for exploring the life game, this is rudimentary â€”
it's just an exercise in using the blitter in a role somewhat beyond its intended purpose,
which was basically just to treat arbitrary pieces of display imagery as sprites, pasting them over a background.

No license, use this however you like.
